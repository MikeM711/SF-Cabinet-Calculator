**Note to self**: Check out my notes on how I would improve this project if I were to create it again.  

Notes are very similar to [WB Door Calculator](https://github.com/MikeM711/WB-Door-Calculator) Repository

To add: Testing would be fantastic, much like my tests in my [Coding Callenges](https://github.com/MikeM711/Coding-Challenges) Repository
